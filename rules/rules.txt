Welcome to the world of fundamental particles!
Here, the rules of Quantum Mechanics and
Einstein’s Relativity make particles appear
from nowhere, travel through walls and behave
in extraordinary ways! Will you ever be able
to understand how it functions? With Tutti
Quantum, you’ll learn seven simple rules for
connecting particles so you can build the
most extravagant Feynman diagram. Each
graph corresponds to a real-world particle
phenomenon, whether that is an explanation
of the blue sky or the discovery of the Higgs
boson. The rarest processes are worth a Nobel
prize… and if you fi nd them, you’ll win – the
game, that is!

GAME COMPONENTS
• 44 elementary particle cards:
GOAL OF THE GAME
The game can be played either competitively or
cooperatively, but we suggest starting with the
competitive mode as you familiarize yourself
with the rules. In both modes, your goal is to
place elementary particles together to form
a Feynman diagram, and so earn yourself the
most points, and the winner will have found the
rarest process in nature.
COMPETITIVE MODE
The players compete to score the most points.
The more points you score, the rarest the
process diagram is.
SETUP
• Give each player a reference card.
• Shuffl e all the particle cards together. If there
are 3 players, randomly discard 5 cards and
put them back in the box: These won’t be
used.
• Give each player one card: This card is kept
secret, and will be added to your diagram after
the fi nal round. Remember it well!
• Place the remaining particle cards face down
in a draw pile. Leave enough space for each
player to make a diagram in front of them.
• Sort the score tokens by type and fl ip half of
them so that all 7 different sides are visible.
Scoring is not limited to the upturned sides:
You can use the reverse side of the tokens.
• Draw the appropriate number of cards and
place them face up in the center of the table.
The chart below specifi es the number of cards
revealed and the number of rounds played:
PLAYERS CARDS ROUNDS
2 3 14
3 4 9
4 5 8
The youngest player will play fi rst, so takes the
fi rst-player pawn.
HOW TO PLAY
Each player will make their own diagram. The
fi rst player chooses an upturned particle card
from the center, and immediately places it in
their diagram. Play continues clockwise, with
each player taking a card in the same way,
and the fi rst player will take the fi nal card. The
fi rst-player pawn then passes to the next player
clockwise, new cards are drawn and placed face
up on the table, and the next round begins.
The game ends when there are no more cards
to draw. All players reveal their secret card and
place it in their diagram.
A complete vertex is a group of 3 cards
arranged around the same point. Some vertices
are valid – since they represent how particles
interact with each other – and so will give you
points; however, invalid vertices will instead
lose you points. When you complete a vertex by
playing a third card around it, you immediately
place the scoring token on it, to show the points
earned. See the “Scoring” section below.
END OF THE GAME
Rules for playing cards
The players place their fi rst card somewhere in
front of them. All subsequent cards must be
placed adjacent to at least one card already on
the table. The cards must be placed in such a
way that the lines meet at the points, which are
called vertices (vertices is the plural of vertex).
The game ends once all the cards have been
drawn and placed, and the players should all
have the same number of particles in front of
them. Everyone counts their points, and the
winner is the one with the most points. In the
event of a tie, the player with the fewest invalid
vertices wins. If the players are still tied, the
winner is the one with the most vertices worth
6 points, then 4 points, 3 points and then
fi nally, 2 points.
SCORING
You score points for every valid complete vertex
in your diagram. The vertices worth more points
represent rarer natural processes.
The illustration on the right shows every
possible complete vertex.
All other complete vertices are invalid, and so
are vertices composed of only 2 different types
of particle. At the end of the game you will
lose 1 point per invalid vertex, since these do
not appear in nature. Incomplete vertices that
are composed of 2 of the same particle are
considered to be valid, but do not give you any
points. Vertices with only 1 particle are ignored
and they don’t lose you points.
Important: The electrons and quarks are
electrically charged particles, indicated by the
arrow on those cards. They must be placed in
such a way that the arrow continues in the same
direction from one card to the next, otherwise
they will create an invalid vertex.

ADVANCED SCORING
You can score 2 bonus points for every valid
loop in your diagram at the end of the game. A
loop is a closed hexagon composed of 6 cards.
For a loop to be valid, it must be composed of 6
valid (complete or not) vertices. You do not get
bonus points for invalid loops.
VALID LOOP
EXPERT SCORING
Are you now an expert in particle physics and
ready to go to the next level? Over the course
of the game, try to form the following subdiagrams.
Count your points in the usual way
at the end of the game, then add points for the
sub-diagrams.
1. Why atoms stay together: In the world of
particles, the electric force is carried by
photons. It keeps electrons and quarks
together in atoms.
2. The blue sky: Light is made up of photons,
and this diagram illustrates how it is refl ected
by matter – i.e. quarks and electrons. This
process is more likely to appear with blue light,
hence the sky’s color.
3. Nobel Prize 2004: Diagrams like this one
have shown that the force inside nuclei is
stronger when the distance is longer and
gets weaker and weaker as the distance gets
shorter, in a similar way to a spring being
pulled out.
4. The discovery of the Higgs boson: In 2012, a
new particle was discovered at CERN through
its decay into two photons, which are light
particles.
Important: Due to the number of cards needed
to build these diagrams, this variant only works
with 2 players (when playing competitively).
If you have more than 2 players, you could
divide the players into 2 teams, or instead play
cooperatively.
COOPERATIVE MODE
In this mode, the players all work together on
the same diagram, and the goal is to make a
valid diagram worth as many points as possible.
SETUP
• Shuffl e all the particle cards together and
place them on the table in a facedown draw
pile.
• Draw the top card from the pile and place it on
the table: This starts the common diagram.
• Each player draws 2 cards and puts them in
their hand.
• Discard the next card from the draw pile
without revealing it.
HOW TO PLAY
The players must never talk about the cards in
their hand. They may tell the others where they
would like to play a card or where the others
should not play, but they are not allowed to be
more precise.
After separately looking at their cards, the
players decide together who will begin. They
take turns clockwise, with each player placing
one card from their hand into the common
diagram. The placement and scoring rules are
the same as for the competitive mode. Once a
player has placed a card, they decide which of
the following two options to play:
— Draw 1 card so your hand goes back up to 2
cards AND discard the top card from the draw
pile without revealing it.
— Discard the card left in your hand without
revealing it AND then draw 2 new cards.
If the draw pile is empty, skip this step and play
until everyone has played all the cards in their
hands.
END OF THE GAME
When all the players are out of cards, the
game ends. If the diagram contains invalid
vertices, the players lose the game. Reminder:
Incomplete vertices featuring the same particle
twice are valid, but all other incomplete vertices
are invalid.
If your diagram is entirely valid, you have
won the game! Count how many points your
diagram is worth and check how well you did in
the table below:
SCORE RESULT
> 38 points
You will probably win
the next Nobel Prize!
35-38 points
You should consider
doing a PhD in Particle
Physics!
32-34 points
You must have
worked as a team
of real experimental
physicists!
29-31 points
You are starting to
understand the secrets
of fundamental
particles, but you’ll
need to communicate
better in the future!
26-28 points
The secrets of
fundamental particles
lie before you, but you
need to spend more
time studying in order
to understand them.
< 26 points
You need to be more
careful when playing
around with subatomic
particles. Study more
and try again!
Have you got the hang of the cooperative
mode? Then try making loops and using
the advanced scoring rules. Add even more
challenge by embarking on one of the expert
scoring “missions”!
